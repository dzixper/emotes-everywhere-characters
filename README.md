# Emotes Everywhere
### Browser extension for custom emotes on any site
The source code for [Emotes Everywhere](https://epalmese.github.io/emotes-everywhere), which lets you create and share custom emote sets for any site. See site for more.

#### Browser Differences
**Chrome**: All settings are handled in the popup menu. The extension is only enabled for chosen sites/hostnames.  
**Firefox**: Emote settings are handled on an options page, because opening a file dialog to import closes the popup menu.
